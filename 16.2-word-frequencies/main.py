#Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in a book. What if we were running this algorithm multiple times?
#Hint 488: Think about what the best conceivable runtime is for this problem. If your solution matches the best 
# conceivable runtime, then you probablycan't do any better.
#Hint 535: Can use a Hash Table to optimize the repeated case?
